TEAM: SPACE CHIMPS
CATEGORY: Don’t Forget the Can Opener!

The Challenge: “Create an easy-to-use way for people to develop their own, custom checklists – both items and plans – for specific kinds of disasters. Use NASA images, videos, or data visualizations to illustrate each disaster type, to help people understand how to prepare.”

Helpie would help users prepare and protect themselves, their loved ones and their property. 
It enables users to get real time notification of an impending natural disaster. 
At the event of natural disasters when internet connection is out or very poor.
